    <p>A community college is a type of undergraduate higher education institution, generally leading to an associate degree, certificate, or diploma. The term can have different meanings in different countries: many community colleges have an open enrollment policy for students who have graduated from high school, also known as senior secondary school or upper secondary school. The term usually refers to a higher educational institution that provides workforce education and college transfer academic programs. Some institutions maintain athletic teams and dormitories similar to their university counterparts.</p>
    <p>A community college offers post secondary education at an affordable rate. Once known as junior colleges, these institutions operate predominantly as two-year schools. Community colleges prepare graduates for the workforce.Depending on their major, graduates can also transfer from a community college to a four-year school to earn a bachelor's degree.</p>
    <p>Community colleges play an essential role in higher education. They provide instruction in a wide variety of fields that lead to employment in sectors such as health care, public safety, information technology, business, and manufacturing. Community colleges prepare students for transfer to four-year colleges and universities, and allow high school students to earn college credits through dual enrollment. They teach adults who are preparing for GEDs or learning English. And community colleges partner with local employers to train or upskill workers needed for regionally important industries and occupations.</p>
    <h1><font color="Black">Community Development</font></h1>
    <img src="images/2.jpeg" alt="" width="100%" height="100%">
    <p>Community development is often linked with community work or community planning, and may involve stakeholders, foundations, governments, or contracted entities including non-government organisations (NGOs), universities or government agencies to progress the social well-being of local, regional and, sometimes, national communities. More grassroots efforts, called community building or community organizing, seek to empower individuals and groups of people by providing them with the skills they need to effect change in their own communities. These skills often assist in building political power through the formation of large social groups working for a common agenda. Community development practitioners must understand both how to work with individuals and how to affect communities' positions within the context of larger social institutions. Public administrators, in contrast, need to understand community development in the context of rural and urban development, housing and economic development, and community, organizational and business development.</p>
<p>At the intersection between community development and community building are a number of programs and organizations with community development tools. One example of this is the program of the Asset Based Community Development Institute of Northwestern University. The institute makes available downloadable tools to assess community assets and make connections between non-profit groups and other organizations that can help in community building. The Institute focuses on helping communities develop by "mobilizing neighborhood assets" â€“ building from the inside out rather than the outside in.In the disability field, community building was prevalent in the 1980s and 1990s with roots in John McKnight's approaches.</p>

<p>Education and skill sharing in the community involve individuals coming together to exchange knowledge, expertise, and practical abilities for the benefit of everyone involved. It can take various forms, such as workshops, classes, mentorship programs, or informal gatherings where people teach each other. This process not only helps individuals acquire new skills but also fosters a sense of solidarity and empowerment within the community.</p>
